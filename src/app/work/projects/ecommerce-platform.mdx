## Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive e-commerce platform built from the ground up using a microservices architecture. The system demonstrates scalability, maintainability, and modern development practices.

## Key Features

### User Management
- JWT-based authentication system
- Role-based access control
- User profile management
- Email verification and password reset

### Product Catalog
- Dynamic product listings with search and filtering
- Category-based organization
- Real-time inventory management
- Product reviews and ratings

### Shopping Experience
- Interactive shopping cart with persistent sessions
- Wishlist functionality
- Order tracking and history
- Mobile-responsive design

### Payment Processing
- Secure payment gateway integration
- Multiple payment methods support
- Order confirmation and receipt generation
- Refund and cancellation handling

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Next.js 14** for server-side rendering and routing
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express.js framework
- **PostgreSQL** for primary database
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **JWT** for authentication

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **AWS EC2** for hosting
- **AWS RDS** for database management
- **CloudFront** for CDN

## Architecture Highlights

### Microservices Design
The application is split into independent services:
- **User Service**: Authentication and user management
- **Product Service**: Product catalog and inventory
- **Order Service**: Shopping cart and order processing
- **Payment Service**: Payment processing and transactions
- **Notification Service**: Email and SMS notifications

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Image compression and lazy loading
- API response caching

### Security Measures
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

## Results and Impact

- **Performance**: Achieved 95% uptime with average response times under 200ms
- **Scalability**: Successfully handled 10,000+ concurrent users during peak testing
- **Security**: Implemented comprehensive security measures with zero reported vulnerabilities
- **User Experience**: Achieved 4.8/5 user satisfaction rating

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me valuable lessons about:
- The importance of proper error handling in distributed systems
- Database design for high-traffic applications
- The complexity of payment processing systems
- Monitoring and logging in production environments

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of GraphQL for more efficient data fetching
- Addition of real-time features using WebSockets
- Integration with third-party logistics APIs
- Advanced analytics and reporting dashboard
